## Description
An app that will display a list of recipes. From the main list of recipes, the user can select the desired 
one and open a details activity that will guide the user to the video guided steps.

## What I learned
* Used Exoplayer to display videos and saved position in order to restore it on the devices' rotation.
* Handled error cases like incomplete API's
* Added widget that displays on the Home screen the selected ingredients list by the user
* Leveraged third-party libraries
* Used fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets
* Used Room as persistence data storage in order to be accessed even when the device has no internet connection
